# Chat SpamBot 


## Description
The Chat Message Spamming Bot is a Python-based automation tool designed to send repetitive messages across various chat platforms. Utilizing the powerful pyautogui module, this bot can simulate keyboard presses to automate the process of typing and sending messages. This project demonstrates the capabilities of pyautogui in creating a simple yet effective spamming bot.


## How to Use 

1.Open any browser and navigate to the desired platform (WhatsApp, Instagram, etc.).
Ensure your cursor is placed in the messaging area of the chat window.

2.Run the main.py file. In the terminal, enter the message you want to spam and the number of times you want to send it.
A countdown will start. Before it reaches it's end, switch to the chat window and wait.

## Note:
If you do not open your chat window in time, the program will start spamming wherever the cursor is currently positioned.
